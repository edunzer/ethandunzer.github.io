	-the computer drops everything, grinds to a halt, and spits out a file reporting the exact contents of its memory at the moment of failure, offering bug hunters a heap of clues to dig through. were built out of wound wire coils known as ferrite cores.
How did Erik Sink, speaking of abstractions, describe what programmers do?
	-"We build piles of abstractions. We design our own abstractions and then pile them up on top of layers we got from somebody else." And every year the piles grow higher.

What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?
	-You, the user, are in front, and the front end is the part of the program that deals with you—that offers windows and dialogues and mouse pointers, tells you what's happening, and provides ways for you to input and output information. The back end is where the results of front-end events and inputs go so that the computer can make sense of them, save them, and retrieve them. 
The terms RAP, SQL, object persistence, all relate to a problem Chandler’s developers needed to solve at the earliest stage. What was the problem?
What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?
	-"In the future, programs will be built out of reusable parts. Software parts will be available worldwide. Software engineering will be set 
free from the mundane necessity of programming." 
Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.
	-well considereing that we are there in many ways already, it think its obvious that something new is going to come up and you have to make something new.

What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?
	-sooner or later someone will end up making every possible unlikely choice that the software allows.
What did M. Kapor argue that software design was? (One sentence.)
	-its not simply a matter of hanging attractive graphics atop the programmers' code. It was the fundamental creative act of imagining the user's needs and devising structures in software to fulfill those needs.
